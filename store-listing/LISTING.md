## Full description (4000 chars max)
ClawHark turns your existing Wear OS watch into a powerful AI wearable — like Omi, Limitless, or Bee, but open source and running on hardware you already own.

🎤 ALWAYS-ON RECORDING
Record your day hands-free. Voice Activity Detection filters out silence automatically, so you only capture what matters. 5-minute WAV chunks ensure nothing is lost.

☁️ AUTOMATIC GOOGLE DRIVE BACKUP
Recordings upload to your Google Drive automatically over WiFi. Local files are cleaned up after upload. Your data stays in YOUR cloud — no third-party servers.

🤖 BUILT FOR AI
Designed to work with AI assistants like OpenClaw. Pull your recordings, transcribe them with speaker diarization, and let AI extract action items, meeting notes, and reminders from your day.

3. Tap START — that's it
4. Recordings appear in your Drive under "ClawHark/"
